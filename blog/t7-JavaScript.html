		So having worked on Ruby for quite a few weeks now, it's been pretty interesting switching over to JavaScript. Truthfully I was worried I wouldn't be able to handle the change well, but I got through this weeks sowkr with a surprising amount of ease. That isn't to say I haven't run into some problems, but overall just knowing what I do about Ruby really helped me work my way into JavaScript without too much trouble. This is because, while the languages are different, there are also a lot of similarties to the way the basics are set up. Things looked familiar to me, even if it wasn't all the same. This is also where my handful of problems came from; trying to remember if it's the same in JavaScript as it is in Ruby, or if there's a different way.

		One of the things I noticed that was different in JavaScript are the functions. Functions are either defined by typing "function" before naming the function, or "var" before the name of the function. I think of "var" as "variable", so basically it's an object. Using "function" is just like it sounds; it has a specific function to do when it's called. In Ruby, you have a few options with completely different syntax. Like classes. A class in Ruby in a block of code that can have several different functions defined inside of it. These functions are usually only accessable inside the class, whereas the functions in JavaScript are, for the most part, accessable anywhere inside the program. Another difference I'm having a hard time remembering is adding a ; to the end of statements in Javascript, which is something Ruby doesn't have.
