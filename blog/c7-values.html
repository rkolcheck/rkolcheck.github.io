		We were asked to think about when we were the happiest, proudest, or most satisfied in our lives, and from those memories pick from a list of values that caused said feelings. We had to rated them on how much we try to live up to those values, before finally chosing one to write about and explain why it was important to us. I chose friendship. As cheesy, after-school-special as it sounds, I've always been the happiest when I had a good relationship with my firends and family, and when I get to be around them more often. Truthfully I'm an introvert; when I want to relax, I want to do so alone. When I feel stressed or sad, I've always preferred an Escapist's life of throwing myself into TV, books, video games, or movies to forget about my troubles. I do enjoy my alone time, but as I've gotten older, I realize I'm much happier when I can spend time with people I really care about. I'm the happiest when I'm around my siblings, goofing off and playing games together. My brothers and sister are my best friends, and spending time with them makes me the happiest I've ever been.

		The last topic someone asked me for advice on was of the dating nature. Mostly it was about dealing with someone whom she found to be cool, but clingy. I find it funny that people always come to me for relationship advice when I've had less experience with it than them, but apparently I give good advice.
		I don't really think about too much when I think of my values. I want to be a good friend, I want to be finacially secure, and I won't do things I don't want to do. That's it. I feel like some values will stick with you forever, but so many other will morph and change as you grow up and learn more about life and who you are. I also don't like to meditate on serious things, as I'm not a serious person. I did mention it in my last blog post, but I'm as far away from stereotype threat as a person It realyl doesn't bother me in the slightest. I guess if it ever did get to me at DBC(though being with such awesome people I doubt it it will even be an issue) I could just think about the people who have been supporting me through the whole experiance. My friends and family have been there for me through this whole experiance, and it's because they're doing so much to help me that I know that I have to get through this, and that I totally can get through it.
