		Earlier in DBC, I was asked to take a personal thinking style test to see what my Gregorc Thinking Style was. Well, I was lucky enough to have a three-way tie. My thinking styles are Abstract Sequential, Abstract Random, and Concrete Random. While it does say that everybody thinks outside thier style at some points, they usually stick to one. I like to think that tieing on three means I have the ability to use different thinking styles more often. If that is actually the case, than I believe I can use this to my advantage, and try to think "outside the box" (or rather, "outside my current thinking style") whenever I get stuck on a challenge at DBC.
		My biggest struggle is getting used to boxing my time and maintaining a schedule for DBC work. I tend to only do things when I feel like it; which sounds pretty lazy,  I know, but if I'm not in the mindset to do something, when I try to force myself to do it anyway I end up mkaing more mistakes, and I get frustrated much easier. If I wait until I'm feeling up to it, I fail a lot less, and I can solve the problems I do have much easier and with less grief. This makes scheduling hard. Since I wait until I'm feeling up to doing homework, it also makes time boxing hard. If I'm feeling up to doing 6 hours of homework at once, then that's what I'll do. I don't like restricting myself into a set amount of time--I like to do things at my own pace. These issues all fall into my three thinking types. The best way I can think to fix this is making a schedule for work and sticking to it. If I timebox myself each time, maybe forcing myself to do it will slowly make it easier for me.

		I feel like having three thinking styles has both great perks, and some annoying disadvantages. Many of the things that are considered "hard" for each of my three thinking styles apply to me. So, while some of them don't really fit, dpeneding on my mood I can have different dificulties at different times. However, this works both ways. I find that I can learn things in many different ways. Lectures, pictures, examples, reading, hands-on work--I can learn different things without having a hard time. I also like getting specific, clear directions--which is actually from Concrete Sequential, which isn't one of my learning styles. I feel like I can really take advantage of this while I'm attending DBC. I'm not saying I'm the perfect student; even though I can learn easily in all these different ways, I do feel limited in the sense that I can learn certain types of things well in certain ways. So I understand things like math well when someone is explaining step-by-step what to do, and I would have a very hard time learning it by reading instructions out of a book on my own. However, when learning things like history, I do best when just reading it by myself.
