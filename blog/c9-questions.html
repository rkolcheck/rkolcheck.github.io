		I have a lot of questions when I work on the challenges for DBC. Most of them are technical in nature, and overall I tend to have a good track record for finding the answer on my own using things like Google. So I've never really had to actually reach out and post a question anywhere on Google+. I believe this is because of a few things. For starters, when it comes to questions on coding, chances are someone's already asked the same question somewhere else. If you're having a problem with something, than ususally someone--if not several someones--has had the same issue, and it's very likely they've turned to the internet for help. That means the answer you need is probably already posted somewhere in the void of the internet; you just have to find it.

		This is where asking the right question comes in. Constructing the perfect question is a wonderful mix of art and science. You can't just type in whatever and expect the right answer. As far as searching for an answer, it's best to use a few, specific words relating to your problem. Being specific is important, but if you go and write a full sentence about your problem into a search engine, you may not get what you're looking for. Often times rewording you search will also yield more results. After that, it's just a matter of hunting down the right answer. If you can't find it this way, and have to ask the question yourself, be as specific as possible about your issue.
