		<h1>Classes vs IDs</h1>
		<h2 id="date">11/09/2014</h2>
	</div>
	<h2 id="subtext">Which one when?</h2>

	<p id="primary"> 
		When starting out to html, it can be hard to decide when it's better to use classes, and when it's better to use ids. First, let's take a quick look at each one.
		Classes are groups you give a title, which you then use in CSS to add things like text size and color. Ids are basically the same, but instead of a group of text, it only applies to one area.
	</p>
	<p id="secondary">
		So say you have three paragraphs of text, and you want them all to look the same. You would you "class" in this case, since it will cover all three paragraphs. But if you have three paragraphs, but you want one to have blue text, one with green text, and one with red text, you would use id. Since they're all supposed to be different, "id" works the best.
