Git, GitHub, and Version Control

What the heck is it all anyway?

Git is a nifty program that runs straight off your computer. It allows you to all sorts of things with things stored on your computer. It's incredibly useful for changing files and tracking said changes. It's like saving checkpoints of your work, making it easy to see what you've done so far, and backtrack if you mess up. 

These checkpoints are a part of something called version control. Version control allows you to to look back at previous versions of your work for reference. It shows you all that you've donto change something, and lets you go back to a previous version if/when you mess up. 

So what's the difference between git and github? Well, while git stores everything on your computer, github allows you to upload those files to the web. This is usefully for several reasons, but most notable is the ability for several different people from various locations to work on one project together.
