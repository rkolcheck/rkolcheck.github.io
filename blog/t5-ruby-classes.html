	<p id="primary"> 
		During your adventures in Ruby, you've probably come across a class before. If you haven't, trust me when I say you will. Like all things involved in learning something new, classes can seem a bit confusing, but once you take a step back and look at them at their most basic, they're really not too complicated. Just think of it like a house; houses have a rooms, windows, and doors. If you had a class called 'house' you could list these things inside that class, making it easy to tell the difference between houses.

		Houses also have functions; you can cook food, take a shower, and sleep in them. Classes have functions too! So by using Classes, we can list both characteristics and functions which define the class. This comes in handy when you're dealing with code you want to be able to change the variable in a set of code easily.
