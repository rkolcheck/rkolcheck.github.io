		For anything you want to get done in Ruby, you've probably got about 20 different ways to accomplish it. Ruby is a very versatile, user-friendly language that gives you a lot of options do get things done. Arrays and Hashes are a good example of things that seem to have a similar function, but each does better at a specific job. So how do you know which one to use?
		Let's take a look at arrays first. To keep things simple, let's just say an array is an object that holds, in order, a list of other objects. Array's can hold any object you want: stings, numbers, and even other arrays! An array within an array--sounds a lot like Inception. While you can influence the  objects inside the array in different ways, if you want to access each object indiviudally it's better to use a hash.

		Hashes are very similar to arrays in the sense that they're also groups of objects,but unlike arrays, each object must have it's own unique marker. This makes it easier to call upon each object on its own. This means that hashes work better for things like lists of information. You can use an array for that, but it can get jumbled up and very confusing; it makes it much harder than it needs to be. Hashes make it incredbly easy to see what your objects are and what they're named. It makes it more organized and easier to read and reference.
