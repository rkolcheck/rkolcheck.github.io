		Pairing for DBC has been such a wonderful part of the experience! I admit I was terrfied of the idea at first; I'm still so new to all of this, and I felt like everyone was ahead of me. I was afraid I would hold my partner back when we paired, and I was worried they would get annoyed with me for not keeping up. Now that I've pair, I can honestly say that I feel silly dreading it before.
		Even when I'm confused about something, having a partner only makes that easier! You'll get confused, and they'll try and help you out. Maybe later they'll be confused, and you can try to help them through it. It's wonderful having someone to bounce ideas off of, and the work gets done so much quicker! It also brings in a whole new set of ideas; while you may be thinking of approaching something one way, the person you're working with may be thinking something totally different! This means you have more options, which is great if things get stuck.

		The nice thing about pairing in DBC is you also get to receive anonomous feedback about how your session went. This was also a pretty scary idea for me at first, but it too proved to be a baseless fear. Everyone tries their best to be kind while also making sure to point out ares of improvement. This is so helpful, because it either points out things I wasn't aware of that I should work on, or it confirms that I'm weaker in areas I notcied myself struggling in.
		I've been pretty surprised to see that people tend to enjoy working with me. I always feel like I'm holding others back, but much of the feedback I've received said I hlped keep things going, and people have said they benefitted from working with me. The things that are pointed out as areas to work on, are things I also thought I needed to do better with. It's nice knowing that the other people I've paired with have gotten as much out of pairing with me as I have with them.
