	<p id="primary"> 
		If you've been in a computer class, been involved in the tech industry, or have just been on a computer in the last few years, you've probably seen/heard a certain word be thrown around. The dreaded "F" word--no not that one--I'm talking about feminism. Now before we get into the how feminism pretains to the tech industry, let's get something clear. Feminism is simply the idea that men and women are equals, and should be treated as such. No bra burning, man hating, or slut shaming here; just equality. So with that in mind, let's get back to the issue. 
		The main point of feminism is equality between the sexes, which is something the tech industry is constantly being berated for not having. It's report that both Microsoft and Google's tech departments are made up of about 17% ladies, while Apple did a little better with about 20%. Men clearly hold most of the ground in the tech world, but the big question here is why. Why are their so few women?

		It could be argued that women tend to take less STEM courses(science, technology, engineering, and math) then men. And while that may be true, it could also reasonably argued that women are less likely to take these courses because they feel intimidated by the men taking them, who feel the need to defend their domain from females. This sort of attitude isn't just reserved for classes; the tech industry has had a long running issue of mistreating women by giving them less opportunity and lower wages. 
		Now, that isn't to say that every man in the tech industry is a misogynist who likes to torment women, and it's not like there aren't incredibly ladies doing the work and getting things done. But there's no denying that discrimination and prejudice against women in the tech industry is a very real issue, and that's something that needs to change.
