	<p id="primary"> 
		The day I learned about DBC, I applied. I had no programing or tech experince of any kind, but I applied anyway. Based off of the info on their site, the people working at DBC seemed fun and committed to helping their students. Having now seen the fireside chat with Shereef, I know that I was right. No matter what kind of group I get in to, I have a hard time making friends and beinf engaged with others. It's not that I don't want to get to know them, I've just never been good at reaching out.

		The cultre at DBC involves so much teamwork. I was worried I would have a hard time getting to know everyone in my cohort, but I see know that was never going to be an issue. It's clear now that all the students--and teachers--are incredibly friendly and helpful.
		I think I'll be able to get along well in this kind of learning environment, and while I am nervous to get things started, I'm also just so incredibly excited! This is the start of a new future for all of us, and I'm so lucky that it's with such a wonderful group of people.
