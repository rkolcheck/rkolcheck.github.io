		<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

		Stereotype threat is basically being at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about a group you fall into. In my case, I'm female, and women are often stereotyped as being worse as STEM-related classes and jobs. Women take fewer STEM classes than men, and I think a lot of it had to due with stereotyping and stereotype threat. 
		That begin said, I can honestly say that I have never avoided STEM classes or jobs. In fact I tend to enjoy STEM classes, and for the most part do well in them. In my life in general, I have tended to like things that were considered stereotypically "male" interest, so that's probably why I've never avoided or done poorly in things like STEM courses.

		That doesn't mean I haven't felt the pressure of being female in a largely male area. Due to my hobbies and interests, I've had to deal with plenty of men who feel like I'm not as dedicated or as interested in these things because I'm a girl. Because this is something I've dealt with most of my life, it doesn't get to me. I know I'm just as big a fan as they are, and I know I can back that up. 
		The same goes for taking STEM classes and working towards a career in technology. I know I'll receive negitivity for being a women, but I also know that I can do this, and I can prove it. My stubbornness restricts me from letting others tell me what I'm able to do.
