		Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
		One Thanksgiving, I got into an argument with my mom. All of my siblings, as well as my grandparents were over at her house, enjoy ourselves and visiting with each other. I was talking to my older brother, when my mom came over to me and started yelling at me because I didn't vacuum(even though I no longer lived there). Initially I was angry that she yelled at me, particularly in front of all our family. Looking at it more closely, I felt annoyed and hurt that she would yell at me specifically about the problem, even though she wasn't asking my three older siblings to do anything. Even though none of us lived with her, she somehoe believed it was my responsibility, but she wanted my other siblings to relax and not help her with anything.

		I didn't take any actions really. I told her I shouldn't have to clean her house, because I was just as much of a guest as everyone else. She was angry at me the rest of the night. I don't think I would have done anything differently. I didn't do anything wrong, and I couldn't have resolved the conflict even if I wanted to, since everyone was already there and there wasn't any time or room to vacuum at that point. I didn't really learn anything so much as I reaffermed the ideas that getting upset about something you can't change is pointless. I couldn't go back and time for her and vacuum, so there was no real point in her getting mad at me to begin with(particularly since it wasn't my responsibilty, but I digress). The only thing she accomplished was makign everyone else feel uncomfortable.
