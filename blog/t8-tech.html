		Going through DBC, you learn a lot about how to code using Ruby. I've often heard people reference Ruby on Rails, but didn't really understand what the heck they were talking about. Having done some research on the subject now, I can still say I'm pretty confused; but at least I know enough now to try and explain it.
		If you google "What is Rails?" you'll get this sentence as a standard answer: "Rails is an open source web application development framework written in the Ruby language." Exciting, right? Let's try to break that down a little bit. 
		Let's start at the beginning. Open source means that it has a free license. In simple terms, it means anyone has permission to use the application at no cost, and can make any changes to it that they want. A web application framework is something programers use to create dynamic websites, web apps, resources, and services. That sounds a bit confusing, but basically it's just a tool to help you build things. The last bit should be pretty obvious; it uses the Ruby language. So broken down, Rails is a free to use web tool that lets you write in Ruby. That's a very basic explination, but it's easier to understand.

		Of course, there's far more to it then that. Really the most important thing to think about it why you would use Rails. Basically Rails is supposed to make things easier for developers. It's what's called an 
		"opinionated software" so it's designed to make assumptions. These assumptions help the developer do things the "best" way, which allows you to write less code. It helps you do things more efficiently, it discourages "bad" practices, and helps you become more efficient overall. This makes it a great tool to help you kick bad habits and do things "The Rails Way". That being said, if you continue to do things it considers to not be best practice, it could be quite a pain to use.
